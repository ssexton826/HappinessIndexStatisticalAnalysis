<h1>Happiness Index - Statistical Analysis </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves analyzing economic indicators that drive happiness index scores in order to inform economist and policy makers on where they should allocate resources to improve overall well-being. It involved importing the Happiness Index 2019 CSV file into a jupyter notebook and performing a statistical analysis using Python. Research questions were defined and hypotheses were developed. Statistical tests, such as t-tests and Pearson correlation coefficient tests, were conducted to test hypotheses related to the impact of certain economic indicators on happiness index scores. 


<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient, scatterplots, etc)</b>
